## REQUIRED: Agent Delegation

**This workflow MUST be executed by a specialized OSINT agent with security expertise.**

Compose the brief from the matching persona in AgentProfiles.yaml (workflow mapping: RiskAssessment → auditor), then dispatch with the host's native agent/Task tool:

```
Agent/Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "OSINT risk assessment for {company}"
  prompt: |
    [Persona block from AgentProfiles.yaml — role, voice, traits]

    Task: Conduct risk assessment for '{company}' including litigation,
    regulatory status, sanctions screening, adverse media, and ESG evaluation.
    Workflow: Read <skill-dir>/Workflows/RiskAssessment.md and follow it.
    Memory: use the adapter in <skill-dir>/SKILL.md § Memory Adapter,
    group "osint-risk".
    Tools: use whatever web/search tools this session provides.
    Escalate back to the main session on judgment calls (legality,
    scope expansion, ambiguous identity) — do not decide alone.
```

**Agent Traits:**
- `intelligence` - OSINT expertise and due diligence tradecraft
- `security` - Understanding of threat models and risk frameworks
- `skeptical` - Critical evaluation of claims, demand evidence

**For Enhanced Due Diligence:** Add `thorough` approach trait for exhaustive analysis.

**Do NOT execute this workflow directly without spawning an agent.**

## Process

### Step 1: Litigation Research
```
Search for legal proceedings:

Civil Litigation:
- PACER (US federal courts)
- State court databases
- Class action databases
- Arbitration records

Criminal Proceedings:
- DOJ press releases
- State AG actions
- Criminal court records

Bankruptcy:
- Chapter 11/7 filings
- Creditor proceedings
```

### Step 2: Regulatory Actions
```
Check regulatory compliance:

Financial:
- SEC enforcement actions
- FINRA actions
- State securities regulators

Industry-Specific:
- FDA warnings/recalls
- FTC enforcement
- EPA violations
- OSHA citations

International:
- EU regulatory actions
- UK FCA
- Other relevant regulators
```

### Step 3: Sanctions & Watchlists
```
Screen against sanctions lists:

US Lists:
- OFAC SDN List
- Entity List (BIS)
- Denied Persons List
- Debarred Parties

International:
- EU Consolidated List
- UN Sanctions List
- FATF Watchlists
- Country-specific lists

Other Watchlists:
- PEP databases
- Adverse media lists
- AML watchlists
```

### Step 4: Adverse Media Screening
```
Search news for negative coverage:

Categories:
- Fraud/misconduct allegations
- Executive scandals
- Product failures/recalls
- Environmental incidents
- Labor disputes
- Data breaches
- Financial difficulties

Sources:
- Major news outlets
- Industry publications
- Local news
- Investigative journalism
```

### Step 5: Corporate Governance
```
Assess governance risks:
- Board independence
- Related party transactions
- Executive turnover
- Audit qualifications
- Internal control weaknesses
- Shareholder lawsuits
```

### Step 6: Financial Red Flags
```
Identify financial risks:
- Going concern warnings
- Delayed filings
- Restatements
- Auditor changes
- Debt covenant issues
- Cash flow problems
```

### Step 7: ESG Risks
```
Environmental, Social, Governance:
- Environmental violations
- Labor practices
- Diversity issues
- Supply chain concerns
- Carbon footprint
- Community relations
```

### Step 8: Risk Scoring
```
Calculate overall risk score:
- Weight factors by severity
- Consider recency
- Factor in remediation
- Compare to industry benchmarks
```

### Step: Store Findings (Memory Adapter)

Store each finding via the memory adapter (SKILL.md § Memory Adapter), group "osint-risk". Path 1 stores one `muninn_remember` per finding (atomic, entity names in [[brackets]], tags `["osint-risk", "osint"]`); Path 2 appends each finding to `./osint-findings/osint-risk.md`.

```
Store the following findings (one memory/entry each):

1. Risk Profile:
   - Label: "Risk: {company_name}"
   - Data: Overall risk score, category breakdown, assessment level
   - Group: "osint-risk"

2. Litigation Record:
   - Label: "Litigation: {company_name}"
   - Data: Active cases, historical cases with outcomes, materiality
   - Relationships: defendant_in, plaintiff_in (muninn_link relates_to)

3. Regulatory Status:
   - Label: "Regulatory: {company_name}"
   - Data: Compliance certifications, regulatory actions, enforcement history
   - Temporal metadata for each action

4. Sanctions Screening:
   - Label: "Sanctions: {company_name}"
   - Data: Screening results for each watchlist (OFAC, EU, UN, etc.)
   - PEP connections, country risk assessment
   - Screening date for temporal validity

5. Adverse Media:
   - Label: "Media: {company_name}"
   - Data: Negative coverage items with severity, source, remediation status
   - Search period and article count

6. ESG Assessment:
   - Label: "ESG: {company_name}"
   - Data: Environmental, social, governance scores and findings
   - Disclosure level assessment
```
